def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
    """
    The function maxVowels takes in two arguments, s which is a string of lowercase English letters, and k which is an integer representing the size of the sliding window.

    The function first creates a set vowels containing all the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

    Then it initializes a variable t with the sum of the number of vowels in the first k characters of the string s.

    Next, it uses a for loop to iterate over the string s starting from the k-th character, and for each iteration, 
    it updates the variable t by adding the number of vowels in the current character of the string and subtracting the number of vowels in the (i-k)th character of the string.

    The function also uses a variable ans to keep track of the maximum number of vowels in any window of size k.

    Finally, it returns the variable ans which contains the maximum number of vowels in any window of size k in the string s.

    :param s: A string consisting of lowercase English letters.
    :param k: An integer representing the size of the sliding window.
    :return: An integer representing the maximum number of vowels in any window of size k in the string s.
    
    Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the length of the string
    Space Complexity : O(1), where the amountof extra space used does not depend on the size of the input.
