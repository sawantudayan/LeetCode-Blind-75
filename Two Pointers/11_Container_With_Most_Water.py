    This function uses a two-pointer approach to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed with the given array of heights. 
    The two pointers start at the beginning and end of the array, and move towards each other. At each step, the area of the rectangle formed by the current heights is calculated and compared to the maximum area found so far. 
    The pointers are then adjusted based on the current heights, with the pointer associated with the smaller height being moved towards the other pointer.

    :param height: A list of integers representing the heights of the 1D array.
    :return: An integer representing the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed with the given array of heights.
